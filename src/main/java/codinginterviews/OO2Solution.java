Anzahl der Segmente in einem String

    Du bekommst eine Zeichenfolge s, gebe die Anzahl der Segmente in der Zeichenfolge zurück.

    Ein Segment wird als eine zusammenhängende Folge von Nicht-Leerzeichen definiert.

    Beispiel 1:
        Input: s = "Hello, my name is John"
        Output: 5
        Erklärung: Die fünf Segmente sind ["Hello,", "my", "name", "is", "John"]

    Beispiel 2:
        Input: s = "Hello"
        Output: 1

    Beispiel 3:
        Input: s = "love live! mu'sic forever"
        Output: 4
        Erklärung: Die vier Segmente sind ["love,", "live!", "mu'sic", "forever"]

    Beispiel 4:
        Input: s = ""
        Output: 0

    Beispiel 5:
        Input: s = """

                   and  praising pain was  born and I will  give you a complete account of the
                   system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth,
                   the master builder of human  happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids
                   pleasure itself, because it  is pleasure, but because those who do not know
                   how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely
                   painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain
                   pain of itself, because it is  pain, but because occasionally circumstances
                   occur in which toil and pain  can procure him some great  pleasure. To take
                   a trivial example, which of us  ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,
                   except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault
                   with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
                   or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"""
